# TASKS

## Todo

- [ ] **Inline Styles** - Extract to CSS modules if dark mode is implemented
- [ ] **Add unit tests** - url.ts, validation.ts, useHoverStyle.ts, get us to 98%
- [ ] **Dark Mode** - Theme toggle (default is dark, needs "soft/non-white light" mode)
- [ ] **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Expand with component patterns and data flow (currently 69 LOC)
- [ ] **TECH DEBT** - any new Strategic codebase cleanup and refactoring remaining (see `TECH_DEBT.md` for remaining or plan out new items to help with management of technical debt and upkeep of code quality over time)
  - [ ] Mobile support & playwright tests increase
  - [ ] User feedback integration
  - [ ] Performance improvements

### High Priority

- [ ] **Wallet Testing Setup** - Setup MetaMask or embedded wallet for local Web3 testing
- [ ] **Contract Deployer** - Track down deployer repo, find contract IDs, etc.
- [ ] **Mumbai → Amoy** - Polygon testnet migration
- [ ] **Visual Assets** - See `SCREENSHOT-REQS.md` for needed screenshots:
  - Crypto page: 4 projects need screenshots
  - Projects page: 3 projects need screenshots  
  - Client demos: 100+ product/content images needed?
  - avatar - maybe we need to update repo to scale this service for us?
