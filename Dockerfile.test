# Dockerfile for running Playwright tests in a consistent environment
# This eliminates dev/CI rendering differences and makes visual tests stable

RUN npm ci --legacy-peer-deps --prefer-offline

# Copy project files
COPY . .

# Don't build - Playwright will start dev server
# This matches CI behavior where dev server is used

# Set environment variables for tests
ENV CI=true
ENV NODE_ENV=test
ENV NEXT_PUBLIC_TEST_HELPERS=1

# Expose port for dev server (if needed)
EXPOSE 3000
