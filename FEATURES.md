<!--
AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:
This file documents features using a structured format for parsing.

CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Use ### (h3) for category headers - DO NOT use ## or ####
2. Category names can include emojis (e.g., "### 📊 Repository Intelligence")
3. Each feature MUST be a bullet list item: "- **Feature Name**: Description"
4. Keep feature descriptions on single lines for reliable parsing
5. You can add brief category descriptions as regular text after the header
6. Avoid nested lists or complex markdown that breaks parsing

GOOD EXAMPLES:
### 🤖 AI-Powered Features
- **Smart Summaries**: Google Gemini-powered repository analysis
- **Auto-categorization**: Detects repo type (web-app, game, tool, etc.)

BAD EXAMPLES (will break parser):
## AI Features (wrong heading level)
- Feature without bold name and colon
  - Nested sub-item (not supported)
- Multi-line feature
  that spans lines (avoid this)

When adding features:
1. Group related features under appropriate ### categories
2. Use bold (**Feature Name**) followed by colon and description
3. Keep descriptions concise and single-line
4. Add emojis to category headers for visual appeal (optional)
