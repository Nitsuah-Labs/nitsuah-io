# Social Preview Image Placeholder

This directory should contain `social-preview.png` (1200x630px) for social media previews.

For now, we have `social-preview.svg` as a placeholder. To create the final PNG:

1. Open the SVG file in a design tool (Figma, Canva, Adobe Illustrator)
2. Export as PNG at 1200x630 resolution
3. Replace this file with the PNG version

## Content Requirements for social-preview.png:
- Dimensions: 1200x630px (Facebook/Twitter recommended)
- Background: Dark theme matching site design
- Text: "Austin J. Hardy - Developer & Researcher"
- Subtitle: Key technologies or project highlights
- Website: "nitsuah.io"
- Style: Professional, clean, readable at small sizes

## Alternative Creation Methods:
- Use online tools like Canva or Pablo by Buffer
- Create with code using libraries like Puppeteer or Canvas
- Design in Figma and export
- Use AI image generators with proper prompts
