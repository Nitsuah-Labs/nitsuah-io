# TODO

- [ ] Keep building out the projects/clients section demo apps from the mock ups. improve them all to get them all "semi" working for the listed features (skip defer for now ones for now like SaaS analytics - list that one last in the SaaS tools). So add fixes, improvements and more features to each below
- [ ] Make sure each demo has a unique emoji/icon to represent it visually in the demo selection area
- [ ] NFT Minting (rename it to be that, remove the "Platform" part of the name) should direct to the minting app (currently points to the marketplace, but not the "mint an nft" page of that specific app when it should)
- [ ] Ecommerce  shop - the work from home bundle should have a page and the add to cart button should work to add that bundle to the cart. the cart should be viewable and the checkout process should be semi functional (up to payment/info that doesnt need to be added yet)
- [ ] Content Management System - the cms demo app should have a way to add/edit/delete posts (at least in memory for now) and be able to view them in the list. add a few more sample posts to the data to show off the functionality a bit more. maybe eventually we can build this out to be a "Hootsuite" competitor type app that can connect to social media accounts and post to them from one place (but for now just make a basic cms that can do basic cms functions in memory) with some dummy record examples for now.
- [ ] Restaurant (just name it that for now, remove the booking part from the name, but keep that function obv.) just make this feel more like an italian restaurant site with menu, about us, contact us, reservation form that works in memory (no backend yet) and a gallery of images of the restaurant food/ambience. etc. just fill it in a bit more without cluttering the existing stuff.
- [ ] Real Estate - (change name to just this) make this demo app feel more like a real estate listing site with property listings, search/filter functionality, property detail pages, contact form that works in memory (no backend yet) and a map view of properties (can be static image for now). just flesh it out a bit more to show off the concept. the list button doesnt seem to do anything - should this be switching to a list/table view?
- [ ] Dental Appt - (change name to just this) make it more responsive to mobile (vertical stack vs. horizntal ) (img 1)
- [ ] Creative Studio/Resume - stack the nav buttons on mobile, (Img2) - make sure they are more responsive/organized on smaller screens too (maybe a vertical list on mobile vs horizontal on desktop) - also flesh out the content a bit more to make it feel more complete as a resume and creative portfolio site.

## Defer for now

- [ ] SaaS Dashboard - this should be a dashboard based upon the other SaaS tools so it should be more of a "data" focused dashboard with charts, stats, user management, settings, etc. similar to the other SaaS apps we have but more fleshed out. It could even use those other sites as "connectors" to pull in data from them to show in the dashboard (vs they may have "simple" dashboards but this one is more of a "meta" dashboard that pulls in data from them all to show in one place across "many" apps, come up with a strategy for that and eventually once we start to hook up everything we'll build the data platform ontop of that too).
