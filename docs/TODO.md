# TODO

- [x] projects/clients - build out working demos for all of the "mockups" - ie: Web3, E-Commerce, SaaS, Services. like actually build out mini versions of each so they appear in the demo section as that app (they dont have to be fully functional, but should look and feel like the real thing with working nav, pages, etc).
- [x] projects/clients - when one card is selected, all of the others should change to "minimal" card versions of themselves (just icon and name, type, view more button but no text,description, technologies,key features).
- [x] projects/clients - make sure all "demo" app content stays within the "demo" area and doesn't overflow outside of it. even the changing "title" should be a part of the demo/app itself to distinguish it from the rest of the page.
- [x] crypto/ - leave some buffer between the cards and the footer s othey dont overlap eachh other.
