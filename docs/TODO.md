# TODO

- [ ] projects/clients - build out working demos for all of the "mockups" - ie: Web3, E-Commerce, SaaS, Services.
- [ ] projects/clients - when one card is selected, all of the others should change to "small" card versions of themselves (just icon and name, type, view more button but no text,description, technologies,key features).
- [ ] projects/clients - make sure all "demo" app content stays within the "demo" area and doesn't overflow outside of it.
- [ ] crypto/ add similar filtering from projects to crypto/ page to filter by type of crypto project (do tags only) refactor as needed, and set 1-2 as "featured" by default.
- [ ]  resume/ - work xp - just show the top 3 items by default (keep the existing "show more" button to expand the rest).
- [ ]  projects/blogs - remove the "placeholder" blogs data for now so that the page doesnt have any active blogs posted. we'll get back to these later.
- [ ]  labs/ home - the buttons in the "sqaures" should be in the center of each square, not the bottom. put it below the heading but above the description text.
- [ ]  crypto/ - the "Ownership, Verification, Innovation" sections should just be a centered bullet list with icons too but not big segments on their own, just together as one bullet list.
