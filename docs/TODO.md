# TODO

**Updated:** November 1, 2025

## Backlog

- [ ] FIX Playwright visual tests to better handle CI/local environment differences - use Docker?
- [ ] Contract debugging on local testnet
- [ ] Network auto-switch detection
- [ ] Projects page filters
- [ ] Mumbai → Amoy migration

## Small nits

- the "website" url in the resume page should be a button like the linkedin and github ones instead of bare url (but in resume pdf keep the similar action where it prints out the full url, etc.)
