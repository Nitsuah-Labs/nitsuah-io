# TODO

- The heading/css size on web3 page seems much different than other pages. investigate and standardize.

- [ ] projects/blogs/ - write a blog about our upgrade to nextjs 16 and react 19 and updating our dependencies. build out the blogs section a bit to make it more usable (maybe read from lib/data/ ? eventually we can hook these all up to webservices is the idea)
- [ ] redesign the "client" demo home page a bit so that it feels more compact. when a demo is engaged some of the content should probably hide or collapse to make more room for the demo itself. could we do a sort of "floating" bar on the left that expands to list the demos available? should the "demo options be in a carosel style format above the demo section? redesign this page so that its more responsive on mobile, but also enhances the "demo" experience to feel more immersive. (so should be h1, text, filters, carosel, then demo area so that the demo is front and center when engaged)
- [ ] when a demo is selected maybe collapse the carosel, the header and filter area to make more room for the demo itself? use projects/ or crypto/ as inspiration a bit (then we'll start building out more demo apps from our mock up ideas)
- [ ] Keep building out the projects/clients section demo apps from the mock ups. improve them all to get them all "semi" working for the listed features.
