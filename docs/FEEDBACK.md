# FEEDBACK

**Updated:** October 28, 2025

- [ ] Header - is too thick, seems to be 2 units instead of 1 (so cut it in half hotdog wise)
- [ ] Spline - i no longer am able to interact with this component? might be placed too far behind? other components or panels? i know they are there because they animate but i cant click or interact wit h them.
- [ ] about - the about me text is overlapped by the nav bar. maybe we should just enhance the current page in the navbar/header instead of having a separate header for that page on the page? i also can no longer interact with the spline component on this page too.....
- [ ] resume - still need dark mode, wtf. do something here. just even dark mode would be a good start, but at the minimum needs header/footer for consistency of navigation. 
- [ ] crypto - this is fine. probably our best page. lets make the icons smaller in the lower section though. still too big compared to the rest of the card content.
- [ ] projects is good but similar to crypto could make the image smaller to match more of the content in the rest of the card but still keep it prominent.
- [ ] labs - home page is still fucky. re-org and fix this page for best practices and ui (it should just be a table of buttons really) but it looks terrible.
- [ ] labs/register - has different injection/walletconnect/coinbase wallet options but all disabled or not able to be selected?
- [ ] standardize lab pages and experiences (up to the point of unique elements for each pages intended purpose) - register, mint, domains, etc to start
