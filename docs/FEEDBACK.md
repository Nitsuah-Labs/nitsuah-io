## QA Feedback Items

- ✅ change pre-push/pre-commit so linting happens earlier and include automation to fix issues where possible. we need to be catching these problems and solving them much sooner.
- ✅ on mobile the top of the resume page is hidden by the nav bar; fix so it's fully visible by giving the top of that heading a bit of extra top padding on mobile?.
- ✅ blogs - preview images on cards are broken. use placeholder arf.png as asset on all of them for now so they dont look broken
