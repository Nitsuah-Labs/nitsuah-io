## QA Feedback Items

### Desktop

- [ ] resume/ page - work xp card content - i still dont like the order and position. figure it out, make it look nice when at either size (desktop/mobile). (pasted img 2)
- [ ] resume/ - work experience should have a "total" bar at the top that sums up all the years worked across all jobs. (e.g. 10 years total). add this to the top of the work experience section. (pasted img 1)
- [ ] crypto/ - on the cards you moved from projects originally they ARE MISSING THEIR ORIGINAL IMAGES! FIND THEM IN ASSET LOCATIONS THAT PROJECTS USES... (PASTED IMG 3)
- [ ] projects/ - The main filter section should have a "caret" like indicator next to where it say "Filters" to indicate that it can be expanded. we keep asking for this but its still not there. QA IS SUPER UPSET ABOUT THIS MISSING FEATURE this is the 5th time youve missed it. (PASTED IMG 5)
- [ ] projectS/ PAGE - THE "FEATURED" star looks like a square currently. IT NEEDS TO BE A STAR shape (but sort of looks like it works, just not visible when it is/isn't and needs to look like a star). (PASTED IMG 4)
