## QA Feedback

- home page - nitsuah to Austin H. animation should type "type" out the text after 1-2 seconds, (right now it only changes on hover)
- projects page - filter area should be neater, and have a caret  to indicate expansion/collapse.
- projects page - filter category should include a "featured" option to show only featured projects.
- projects page - filter by tags should only show remaining tags based on current filtered projects.
- projects page - filter by tags should filter by multiple tags to match, not just any that are selected (it allows multi-already but doesnt filter by ALL selected tags)
- projects page - "featured" should be a star that we can interact with to toggle a card as featured or not - worry about persistence later (right now its just a button/label-text in the top right of the cards)
- projects page - the "Coming Soon..." project should be visually distinct from the others to give it a bit more visual appeal, maybe a gradient of black/orange? or something dynamic that changes/holo-card effect.
- projects page - filter by Category should be located inline with the "Filters" heading above it for better UX.
