## Active Feedback

✅ **PHASE 7 COMPLETED:**

- ✅ resume page - export PDF text now dark grey for contrast, portfolio URL is now a button, LinkedIn/GitHub have enhanced styling with icons
- ✅ crypto - added 200px footer buffer to prevent overlap
- ✅ projects - project cards maintained (use gradient backgrounds), reorganized with Websites & Apps at top, added rowSpacing for proper card separation
- ✅ labs - test funds button overlap fixed with explicit margin/padding
- ✅ labs nav - WIP links non-clickable with red hover, Profile button matches purple/black theme, navigation shows "NITSUAH LABS", logout button styled with purple/black gradient

### Layout & Styling

- ✅ **Resume Layout** - Improved about section with styled profile links featuring icons and hover effects
- ✅ **Resume Export Button** - Styled with orange/black theme and dark grey text for contrast

### Features

- [ ] **Projects Filters** - Add categories/filters based on tags
- [ ] **Lab Wallet Connection UX** - Simplify to modern wallet selector pattern, see web3 section below

### Web3

- [ ] **Wallet Flow** - Auto-detect/redirect to install if wallet missing (this should be a natural part of the connect wallet flow already i think we need to dig into the wallet features further to understand the expected best practice - learn about the packages we use, web3/wagmi/etc. whatever were using and deep dive on those.)

- [ ] **/profile Page** - Display wallet info on profile and labs header

## Future Ideas
