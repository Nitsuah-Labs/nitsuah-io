## Active Feedback

- [x] **Homepage Scroll Experience** - ✅ COMPLETED - Homepage now has continuous scroll with hero overlay that peels away, revealing projects underneath, then Spline scene loads further down.

- [x] **Logo Animation Behavior** - ✅ COMPLETED - Logo switches to "AUSTIN H." on hover and stays that way. Clicking navigates to homepage.

- [x] **Page Bottom Spacing** - ✅ COMPLETED - Added 120px bottom padding to crypto and labs pages for better footer spacing.

### Layout & Styling

- [ ] **Resume Layout** - Improve about section (button, city, GitHub, LinkedIn positioning)
- [ ] **Resume Export Button** - Style PDF button to match orange/black theme

### Features

- [ ] **Projects Filters** - Add categories/filters based on tags
- [ ] **Lab Wallet Connection UX** - Simplify to modern wallet selector pattern, see web3 section below

### Web3

- [ ] **Wallet Flow** - Auto-detect/redirect to install if wallet missing (this should be a natural part of the connect wallet flow already i think we need to dig into the wallet features further to understand the expected best practice - learn about the packages we use, web3/wagmi/etc. whatever were using and deep dive on those.)

- [ ] **Profile Page** - Display wallet info on profile and labs header
