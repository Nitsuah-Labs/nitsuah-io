## Deployment Feedback

- [x] the header/nav bar nitsuah/austin h. should just change on hover (keep it simple since you keep fucking it up)
- [x] scroll for more - on about/ and home app pages should only appear after a second or two delay, not immediately on page load.
- [x] resume/ - work xp section - i dont like "click to expand" use a downward chevron icon that rotates up/down on expand/collapse.
- [x] resume/ - work xp section - the cards on mobile/smaller widths the start/end & expand chevron should align to the right of the card, with the time bars and text below it also aligned right, this way the title/company is left aligned at the top of the card when its small, a bigger resolutions the present organization is fine so just including img 2 for reference, chevrons will help most for expand/collapse. (see img1 & 2)
- [x] resume - export pdf button still missing the emoji/text - whatever fucking ICON thing you think you are doing is not fucking work ok???
- [x] resume - link buttons for web, github, linkedin STILL dont have logos/icons displayed - so really take a step back and thing on the logos/assets. USE EMOJIS IF YOU HAVE TO.
- [x] projects/blogs - add placeholder arf.png image from assets TO THE BLOG CARDS for now.
- [x]  /labs (pasted image 2) - lab nav - still no EMOJI icons on the home logo (orange left side) PLEASE FIX THIS AND ADD A HOME EMOJI HERE.
- [x]  /labs - lab nav - the profile and logout buttons should start as EMOJI OR "icon" only buttons then show their text when hovered or focused. please fix this they are complaining. NOW THERES NOT EVEN TEXT WHEN HOVERED. (QA IS MAD)
- [x]  /labs - sub nav of site - home button/option should be a home icon or emoji instead of nothing (which is currently the case - AXD team is angry)
