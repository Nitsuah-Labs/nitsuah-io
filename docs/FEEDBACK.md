## QA Feedback Items

### Desktop

- [ ] about/ page - the header "About Me" should have less space above it (and thus the scroll down for more is still hidden partway behind the footer) (pasted img 2)
- [ ] about/ page - make the last section say "when im not coding that im usually working on my 78 corvette or my 81 silverado truck." or something like that.
- [ ] resume/ page - under the about section, the button for "Projects" is missing, add it back please (or got removed? but should point to /projects)
- [ ] resume/ page - buttons under about section, when on mobile should be stacked in a grid that scales them nicely to fit the available space. (pasted img 1)
- [ ] resume/ page - there should be a bit of space between sections like about and work experience, currently the  follow each other with no space between.
- [ ] resume/ page - the cards for work experience should not be auto-expanded by default, they should be collapsed by default (only when clicked on should they change). Right now it makes the page way too long and hard to navigate.(pasted img 3)
- [ ] resume/ page - the work xp cards are missing their start & end dates, please add them back in. (pasted img 3)
- [ ] resume/ page - the work xp cards should have the job title and company on one side, and the dates, orange bars, and time duration on the right side. (the left is fine, the other stuff is not) (pasted img 3)
- [ ] the problems with the work xp cards happen on mobile as well as desktop. please evaluate fixes that consider both. (pasted img 4 for desktop view compared to others which were mobile)
