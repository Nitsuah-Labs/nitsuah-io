- [ ] resume - on mobile the print pdf button appears behind the nav bar (it should be on top of the nav bar visually)
- [ ] resume - on mobile/small width the top of my name is not visible (cut off by nav bar height, so might just need some top padding or margin on the main content area?)
- [ ]  resume - xp cards on mobile should maintain alignment intent or align left for all.
- [ ]  resume - green "current" indicator should be same hight as the year bars next to it for consistency. and next to it to indicate growth (so treated like its own cell)
- [ ]  resume - languages section (the bottom) gets cut off a bit at the end on mobile.
- [ ]  gobackup - carrot should actually be a carrot, not a square, also cleanup the old buttons/circles from about and home. but REGARDLESS this needs to be a triangle upward and it needs to be in the FOOTER BAR. NOT IN THE PAGE.
- [ ]  projects - lower cards are still not what we want. replicate how the featured project ones react to onhover n shit. jesus christ. right now they just take up a ton of space and pop out when hovered. but then they dont go back to being small when not hoevered over. (pasted img 2)
- [ ]  /labs NAV BUTTONS STILL DONT HAVE ICONS OR EMOJIS BY DEFAULT DISPLAYED AS THE "TEXT".
- [ ]  /labs nav on mobile should use color scheme from labs (so grey/black/purple not blue/darkblack)
- [ ]  /labs home  

## Feature Requests

- [ ] Setup Docker and re-enable skipped playwright visual tests
- [ ] FIX Playwright visual tests to better handle CI/local environment differences
- [ ] Expand CLIENTS & BLOGS pages (they exist already under projects/ path) - so build out blogs to be an "interactive" blog site where we can upload blogs but also view/upvote/etc., for Clients have a switcher in the site app that helps us switch to different "app types". Professional client work examples and storefront demonstrating commercial project capabilities. /projects/clients site to include multiple different types of "customer" projects. mainly traditional service/freelance/consumer apps. come up with a top 10 list and we'll build them out as we have time or as we finish other higher priority items. this is our mono repo so we're fine to toss in more stuff here as long as it doesnt overly bloat the codebase/repository/dependencies. so "within reason" mostly mock ups vs. fully working apps unless its a super simple one off or we find a middleware or headless CMS to help speed along development of these types of projects. (ie: magento headless CMS for ecommerce store front, or sanity.io for blog/CMS type site, etc.) you get the idea. maybe even a small store front or mom&pop shop example.
