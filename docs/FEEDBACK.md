### Desktop

- [ ] resume/ - total experience card background should be grey like the other cards. the "total experience" text can be h6 or something to accent it enough.
- [ ] crypto/ - add a small "blurb" about <3 why it matters to me in a sentence or two at the bottom of that main body/text section
- [ ] crypto/ - headers and all text on the cards (and labels) should be a bit bigger/scale to be readable easily on bigger screens (but all of the card text is a bit too small on mobile too)
- [ ] projects/ - View button should get a cool gradient style glow like the "coming soon" card.... instead of purple.
- [ ] projects/clients - add an icon/placeholder image to the client cards to make them more visually appealing (can use emoji, opensource logo, image, icon to start)
- [ ] resume/ - on total experience card on mobile the years bars are overflowing the card width - need to make them wrap or scale down better on small screens (both might work too)
- [ ] labs/ - on home, network card, add the wallet connect button the "disconnected" status button we have there (when working we'll use that button to show us when a successful connection has occurred)
- [ ] resume/ - Change total experience bar to subtle gray gradient with left orange border accent (its still white when it should be grey)
