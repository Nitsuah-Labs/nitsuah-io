## QA Feedback Items

### Desktop

- [ ] resume/ page - on desktop/wider view on the work xp section for each card the start/end dates, orange bars, and time duration should be on the right side of the card. (the left/title/company is fine, the other stuff is currently at the bottom just aligned right) also put the text/indicator on the left of the bars instead of the right. should buy us some space and use up the dead space (pasted img 2 - with red lines for where things should be placed, order ie: put start/end on the bottom but move both to the upper right of the card, how mobile has it/shorter width mode order is fine)
- [ ] crypto/ - on the cards you moved from projects you forgot to update the images.
- [ ] projects/ there is a white section that appears behind the header when scrolling (but it appears by default on the page) (pasted img 1)
- [ ] projects/ - The main filter section should have a "caret" like indicator that it can be expanded. we keep asking for this but its still not there.
- [ ] projects/ Filters by Category - "Featured" should just be a "star" emoji/icon/logo instead of the full word "Featured"
- [ ] project - Instead of the interactive circle on the project card make it a neat star that glows or otherwise stands out more (so tl;dr a star with colors like the coming soon card, but still have the same click on/off functionality)
- [ ] projects/ - For "Filter by Tags" - the tags available to filter by should be dependent on the projects that are currently visible. so if you select "open source" only the tags that are in the open source projects should be available to select from. (currently all tags are always shown). may be heavy and dynamic but would be a nice touch and show prowess.
