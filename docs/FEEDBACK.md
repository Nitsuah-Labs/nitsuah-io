# FEEDBACK

- home - the spline component is now TOO small. it should take up 100% of the width and the height should fall behind the header/nav bar and the footer. currently it looks like a tiny box in the middle of the screen.

- about me - the spline component is good here! i also like the about me text in the header when we're on that page. but when the window is sized smaller the nav bar text covers the about me text. they should not overlap and the about me can be moved to the top right of the bar if needed when the window is smaller. but otherwise this is a great & simple page.

- resume should match some of the formatting of the overall site. the white background with black text is jarring compared to the rest of the site. maybe a dark mode toggle for the resume page? or a different color scheme that matches the rest of the site better? we'll come back to this for more updates but fixing that (and having the header/footer) would be a good start to keep unity.

- crypto - this is PERFECT. exactly what i am looking for in improvements. we can even tone down the heading in the body and simplify it like about me has in the header/nav bar. but this is great.

- projects - this is getting better. but the icons should be smaller for the lower project section. also the text should be aligned better. right now the text is somewhat centered under the icons. it should be best practiced centered so it can adjust dynamically for screen sizes. also the spacing between the two sections should be larger. (so each row has space from the row below it) maybe add a dividing line or something to separate them more clearly. - reorganize the list into an order that makes sense (with less impressive or older projects at the bottom) - also the project descriptions should be a bit more concise. they are too long right now and take away from the overall look of the page. some of them are good though, but others duplicate the keywords too much or are just too wordy.

- LABS - labs/
- this needs the most work. 
- first is that the entire app looks like its inside another app. there is a white border around everything and it looks like a box inside the page. this should be removed so the app takes up the full width of the page with no borders.
- second the header/footer should be standardized on these pages as well to keep unity across the site. its close, but might miss some of our other improvements we made on main. 
- register - looks better. but the connect a wallet button or injection is still broken. idk what thje current or supported best practices are for web3 wallet connections but this is not working currently.
- footer - the footer should be fixed to the bottom of the page so if there is not much content it still stays at the bottom. right now its floating in the middle of the screen if there is not much content.
- header - missing links to other parts of the labs site. should have links in the nav bar like the rest of the site. with matching header page names when navigating as well.
- landplot - just shows connect your wallet and nothing else. i have 2 wallets connected. coinbase wallet and phantom for anything solana. but neither gets a prompt to connect to the site.

Your wallet isn't connected to this site. If it's a crypto dapp, you should see a “Connect Wallet” button. Click it to connect."
