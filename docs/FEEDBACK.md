The catch block comment 'ignore' is too generic. Consider a more descriptive error message explaining why this error is acceptable to ignore (e.g., 'URLSearchParams may fail in SSR environments').

Suggested change
      // ignore
      // It is safe to ignore errors here because URLSearchParams or window.location may not be available
      // in some environments (e.g., during SSR or non-browser contexts). In such cases, test helpers are not shown.

  // createConfig expects a readonly tuple type; cast safely to the expected
  // readonly [Chain, ...Chain[]] to satisfy the signature while preserving
  // proper runtime values.
  const typedChains = chains as unknown as readonly [Chain, ...Chain[]];

[nitpick] The type casting is well-documented, but consider using a type assertion helper function to make this pattern reusable if used elsewhere in the codebase.


## Feedback from Copilot

The goal of HomePagev2 is to make it immediately clear **who Austin J. Hardy is** and **what he does**, while keeping the site‚Äôs minimal and ‚Äúcool‚Äù navigation intact.

Visitors should instantly understand:  
> You‚Äôve stumbled onto the site of a senior systems and developer-productivity engineer who builds tools, automation, and research systems.

Every design and content decision should help answer:
- Who is this person?
- What do they do?
- Why should I click the next button?

The website should feel intentional, modern, and distinctly ‚ÄúAustin.‚Äù
TL;DR - lets make it one of those cool "scroll to unlock more without actually moving anything on the page" type things where its interactive to get to the cool stuff behind the scenes. keep the existing sitemap intact, just focus on improving the homepage and main navigation experience (while keeping the spline component as the cool behind the scenes element to unlock with a scroll while highliting the following better)
---

## 1. Homepage (Landing Section)

### Objective
Turn the homepage into a powerful identity anchor that defines the brand and sets expectations.

### Required Changes
- Add a **hero section** with:
  - **Main heading:**  
    Hi, I‚Äôm Austin Hardy ‚Äî Developer Productivity Engineer & Researcher.
  - **Subheading / value statement:**  
    I build tools and platforms that help engineers move faster and systems scale smarter.
  - **Primary CTA buttons:**  
    - Explore My Work ‚Üí `/projects`  
    - About Me ‚Üí `/about`

- Ensure this section loads instantly (no ‚Äútakes time to load‚Äù message).

### Design Notes
- Keep the current navigation ‚Äî it‚Äôs visually clean and modern.  
- Add visual contrast between the hero section and rest of page (e.g., subtle background gradient or texture).  
- Include subtle motion or scroll cue to signal there‚Äôs more below.

## 2. Navigation & Flow

### Goal
Leverage the existing navigation‚Äôs ‚Äúcool‚Äù style but improve clarity of intent.

### Changes
- Keep top-bar nav items but ensure they‚Äôre self-explanatory.
  - **Projects** ‚Üí ‚ÄúThings I‚Äôve built‚Äù  
  - **About** ‚Üí ‚ÄúWho I am and what drives me‚Äù  
  - **Contact** ‚Üí ‚ÄúHow to reach out‚Äù

### Optional Microcopy
Add tooltips or hover-text for nav items for added clarity.

---

## 3. Selected Projects

### Objective
Highlight **3‚Äì5 hero projects** that define your technical breadth and personality.

### Content Format
Each project card should include:
- Title (e.g., Kryptos)  
- Short summary (1 line)  
- Highlight (why it matters)  
- Tags (Python, Research, Automation)  
- GitHub link  
- Optional demo or screenshot link

### Implementation
- Use a static file (`data/projects.ts`) for this data.  
- Render these cards on both:
  - Homepage (as a preview / highlight)  
  - `/projects` page (as a full list)

### Content Example
Kryptos ‚Äî cryptanalysis toolkit solving classical ciphers using testable pipelines.  
GCP ‚Äî automation scripts for Drive API reporting & migration.  
Stash ‚Äî system admin utilities and Atlassian helpers.

### Visual Design
- Each card clickable (GitHub / demo).  
- Keep consistent spacing and typography.  
- Fast-load; no heavy animations.

## 4. About Page

### Objective
Make this a short but memorable personal summary.

### Structure
1. **Who I am**  
   Austin J. Hardy ‚Äî Senior Systems & Developer Productivity Engineer  
2. **What I do**  
   I build tools that automate workflows, scale engineering systems, and make developers happier.  
3. **Why I do it**  
   I enjoy bridging research and infrastructure ‚Äî turning clever ideas into reliable systems.  
4. **Currently working on**

## 5. First-Impression Rule

Visitors should know within **5 seconds**:
- Who you are  
- What you do  
- Why they should care  
- Where to click next  

To achieve that:
- Keep messaging concise.  
- Emphasize your professional identity visually (large type, consistent hierarchy).  
- Include clear CTAs and visible ‚Äúnext steps.‚Äù

---

## 6. Future Additions (for v2.5+)

- SEO: add meta tags, page titles, and Open Graph previews (`og:title`, `og:image`).  
- Performance: use `next/image`, compress assets, and lazy-load noncritical scripts.  
- Accessibility: test with Lighthouse (aim for 90+ across metrics).  
- Add ‚ÄúWriting‚Äù section or blog for thought leadership content.  
- Optional: dark mode toggle.
