## Active Feedback

- [ ] **Homepage Scroll Experience** - Transform homepage into a single continuous scroll. The hero section ("Hi, I'm Austin Hardy") should act as an overlay that peels away as you scroll, revealing the Featured Projects section underneath. Further scrolling should then load the Spline 3D scene. Currently feels disjointed with separate sections.

- [ ] **Logo Animation Behavior** - The "nitsuah" â†” "austin h." animation should trigger on hover and remain in that state. Clicking the logo should navigate to the homepage.

- [ ] **Page Bottom Spacing** - Add spacing/padding at the end of short pages (crypto, labs) so the footer doesn't feel jammed against the viewport bottom. Apply globally to all pages if needed.

### Layout & Styling

- [ ] **Resume Layout** - Improve about section (button, city, GitHub, LinkedIn positioning)
- [ ] **Resume Export Button** - Style PDF button to match orange/black theme

### Features

- [ ] **Projects Filters** - Add categories/filters based on tags
- [ ] **Lab Wallet Connection UX** - Simplify to modern wallet selector pattern, see web3 section below

### Web3

- [ ] **Wallet Flow** - Auto-detect/redirect to install if wallet missing (this should be a natural part of the connect wallet flow already i think we need to dig into the wallet features further to understand the expected best practice - learn about the packages we use, web3/wagmi/etc. whatever were using and deep dive on those.)

- [ ] **Profile Page** - Display wallet info on profile and labs header
