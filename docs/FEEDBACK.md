## Feature Requests

- [ ] Setup Docker and re-enable skipped playwright visual tests
- [ ] FIX Playwright visual tests to better handle CI/local environment differences
- [ ] Expand CLIENTS & BLOGS pages (they exist already under projects/ path) - so build out blogs to be an "interactive" blog site where we can upload blogs but also view/upvote/etc., for Clients have a switcher in the site app that helps us switch to different "app types". Professional client work examples and storefront demonstrating commercial project capabilities. /projects/clients site to include multiple different types of "customer" projects. mainly traditional service/freelance/consumer apps. come up with a top 10 list and we'll build them out as we have time or as we finish other higher priority items. this is our mono repo so we're fine to toss in more stuff here as long as it doesnt overly bloat the codebase/repository/dependencies. so "within reason" mostly mock ups vs. fully working apps unless its a super simple one off or we find a middleware or headless CMS to help speed along development of these types of projects. (ie: magento headless CMS for ecommerce store front, or sanity.io for blog/CMS type site, etc.) you get the idea. maybe even a small store front or mom&pop shop example.
