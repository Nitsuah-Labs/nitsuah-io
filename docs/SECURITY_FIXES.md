# Security Audit

**Last Updated:** November 1, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… Production Ready

## Current Status

No high severity or impactful vulns. Some low severity related to WalletConnect that may need updates or review (it is on the latest?) Also some dependnency updates pending that may address some other issues or need evaluation/testing.

## Low Severity Details

**18 vulnerabilities** in WalletConnect packages:

- `fast-redact` (prototype pollution in logger - internal only)
- `@reown/appkit` transitive dependencies
- All affect non-production code paths (logging, development tools)

**Action:** Waiting on upstream package updates. Safe to ignore.

---

## Maintenance

Run security audit before deployments:

```bash
npm audit
npm audit --audit-level=moderate  # Fail on moderate+
```
