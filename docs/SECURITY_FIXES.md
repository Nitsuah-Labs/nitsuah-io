## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

### 1. Webpack Module Resolution Warnings (October 31, 2025)

**Problem:**
- `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` - Module not found
- `pino-pretty` - Module not found
- `lokijs` - Module not found (uninstalled)
- `encoding` - Module not found (uninstalled)

**Root Cause:**
These are optional peer dependencies expected by third-party packages:
- **MetaMask SDK** looks for `@react-native-async-storage` (React Native support)
- **WalletConnect** looks for `pino-pretty` (Node.js logging)
- Not actually needed in browser environment

**Solution Applied:**
Added webpack fallback configuration to `next.config.js`:

```javascript
webpack: (config, { isServer }) => {
  if (!isServer) {
    // Ignore optional dependencies that aren't needed in browser
    config.resolve.fallback = {
      ...config.resolve.fallback,
      '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage': false,
      'pino-pretty': false,
      'lokijs': false,
      'encoding': false,
    };
  }
  return config;
}
```

**Result:**
- ‚úÖ Webpack warnings silenced
- ‚úÖ No functional impact (these were never used)
- ‚úÖ Build time unchanged
- ‚úÖ Bundle size unchanged

### Action Plan

#### Step 1: Auto-Fix Safe Updates
```bash
npm audit fix
```

This will automatically update packages with non-breaking fixes.

#### Step 2: Review Remaining Issues
```bash
npm audit
```

Review detailed vulnerability report to identify:
- Which packages are affected
- Severity levels
- Available patches
- Breaking changes required

#### Step 3: Manual Updates (if needed)
```bash
npm audit fix --force
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** This may introduce breaking changes. Test thoroughly after running.

#### Step 4: Document Unfixable Issues

Some vulnerabilities may not have fixes available yet (waiting on upstream maintainers). Document these in this file with:
- Package name and version
- Vulnerability description
- Why it can't be fixed (no patch available, breaking change too severe, etc.)
- Mitigation strategies (if any)
- Link to upstream issue tracker

## Vulnerability Categories

### Low Severity (18 vulnerabilities)
- **Impact:** Minimal risk in production
- **Priority:** Low
- **Action:** Fix during regular maintenance cycles
- **Examples:** 
  - Prototype pollution in nested dependencies
  - RegEx DoS in dev-only tools
  - Path traversal in unused code paths

### Moderate Severity (3 vulnerabilities)
- **Impact:** Should be addressed soon
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Action:** Fix in Phase 7.3 (Week 4, Day 1)
- **Common Issues:**
  - XSS vulnerabilities in dev dependencies
  - Unvalidated redirects in unused features
  - Information disclosure in logging

### High/Critical Severity (0 vulnerabilities)
- ‚úÖ None currently!

---

## Best Practices

### Regular Audits
- Run `npm audit` weekly during active development
- Run `npm audit` before every deployment
- Review new vulnerabilities in Dependabot alerts (if enabled)

### Safe Update Strategy
1. **Always test after updates:**
   ```bash
   npm audit fix
   npm run typecheck
   npm run lint
   npm run test
   npm run test:e2e
   ```

2. **Update one major dependency at a time:**
   - Easier to identify breaking changes
   - Simpler rollback if needed
   - Better git history

3. **Pin critical dependencies:**
   - Use exact versions (`1.2.3`) not ranges (`^1.2.3`) for critical packages
   - Prevents unexpected breaking changes
   - Update manually with intention

### CI/CD Integration

Add to GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
- name: Security Audit
  run: npm audit --audit-level=moderate
```

This will fail the build if moderate or higher vulnerabilities are found.

## Dependency Management

### Production Dependencies (494 packages)
- **Audit Level:** High priority
- **Update Frequency:** As needed for security patches
- **Testing:** Full E2E suite required

### Development Dependencies (648 packages)
- **Audit Level:** Medium priority
- **Update Frequency:** During major releases
- **Testing:** Unit + E2E smoke tests

### Optional Dependencies (106 packages)
- **Audit Level:** Low priority
- **Update Frequency:** Opportunistic
- **Testing:** Basic smoke tests

---

## Phase 7.3 Security Checklist

- [x] Fix webpack module resolution warnings
- [ ] Run `npm audit fix` for auto-fixable issues
- [ ] Review and manually fix moderate severity issues (3 remaining)
- [ ] Document any unfixable vulnerabilities with mitigation plans
- [ ] Add security audit to CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Update DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md with security audit procedures
- [ ] Set up Dependabot or Renovate for automated dependency updates

---

## Known Safe-to-Ignore Issues

### Development-Only Vulnerabilities
Some vulnerabilities only affect development dependencies (Jest, Playwright, ESLint, etc.) and pose no risk in production:

- Test frameworks (Jest, Playwright)
- Linters (ESLint, Prettier)
- Build tools (webpack, SWC)
- Documentation generators

**Mitigation:** These packages are in `devDependencies` and never shipped to production.

### Transitive Dependencies
Some vulnerabilities are in dependencies of dependencies (transitive):

**Mitigation:** Wait for upstream packages to update, or use `npm audit fix --force` if critical.
