---

## üéØ Primary Objectives

### 1. Homepage Redesign (Priority: CRITICAL)

**Goal:** Create an interactive, scroll-based homepage that immediately communicates who Austin J. Hardy is and what he does, while maintaining the site's minimal, modern aesthetic.

#### Requirements

**Hero Section (Above the Fold):**
- [ ] Add hero heading: "Hi, I'm Austin Hardy ‚Äî Developer Productivity Engineer & Researcher"
- [ ] Add value statement: "I build tools and platforms that help engineers move faster and systems scale smarter"
- [ ] Add primary CTAs:
  - "Explore My Work" ‚Üí `/projects`
  - "About Me" ‚Üí `/about`
- [ ] Ensure instant load (no loading message for critical content)

**Interactive Scroll Experience:**
- [ ] Implement scroll-to-reveal interaction (unlock content without page jumps)
- [ ] Keep Spline component as "cool behind the scenes" reveal element
- [ ] Add scroll cue indicator for discoverability
- [ ] Maintain existing sitemap/navigation structure
- [ ] Add subtle background gradient or texture for visual depth

**Featured Projects Section:**
- [ ] Highlight 3-5 hero projects on homepage
- [ ] Each card includes:
  - Title
  - One-line summary
  - Why it matters (impact statement)
  - Technology tags
  - GitHub link
  - Optional: demo/screenshot link
- [ ] Use `src/lib/data/projects.ts` as data source
- [ ] Ensure fast load, minimal animations

**Navigation Improvements:**
- [ ] Keep existing clean top-bar nav
- [ ] Add clearer microcopy/tooltips on hover:
  - Projects ‚Üí "Things I've built"
  - About ‚Üí "Who I am and what drives me"
  - Contact ‚Üí "How to reach out"
- [ ] Ensure navigation is accessible and mobile-friendly

**First Impression Test:**
- [ ] Verify visitors understand within 5 seconds:
  - Who you are
  - What you do
  - Why they should care
  - Where to click next

### 2. Technical Debt & Dependency Cleanup (Priority: HIGH)

#### Unused Dependencies (Confirmed)
- [ ] Remove `lokijs` (^1.5.12) - No usage found in codebase
- [ ] Remove `pino-pretty` (^13.1.2) - No usage found in codebase
- [ ] Remove `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` (^2.2.0) - React Native package, not needed for Next.js
- [ ] Remove `encoding` (^0.1.13) - Verify if transitive dependency, remove if unused
- [ ] **Keep** `utf-8-validate` and `bufferutil` - Used by WalletConnect for performance

**Expected Impact:**
- Bundle size reduction: ~100-200KB
- Faster npm install
- Reduced attack surface
- Fewer packages to maintain

#### Security Vulnerabilities (21 total: 18 low, 3 moderate)

**Moderate Priority Fixes:**
- [ ] Update `esbuild` (<=0.24.2 ‚Üí 0.25.1) - Development server request vulnerability
- [ ] Update `micromatch` (<4.0.8 ‚Üí 4.0.8+) - ReDoS vulnerability affecting lint-staged
- [ ] Review WalletConnect/Reown chain (18 low severity) - Prototype pollution in fast-redact affecting @walletconnect/* packages

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Run `npm audit fix` for non-breaking updates
- [ ] Test `npm audit fix --force` in separate branch for breaking changes
- [ ] Review and merge Dependabot PRs: https://github.com/Nitsuah-Labs/nitsuah-io/security/dependabot
- [ ] Update documentation after fixes

---

### 3. Web3 Infrastructure Updates (Priority: MEDIUM)

#### Mumbai ‚Üí Amoy Testnet Migration
- [ ] **Status Check:** Amoy already implemented in `src/wagmi.ts` ‚úÖ
- [ ] Verify Mumbai contracts still needed (currently both Mumbai + Amoy are active)
- [ ] Update contract addresses if migrating
- [ ] Test all Web3 functionality on Amoy
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect testnet changes
- [ ] Consider deprecating Mumbai if no longer needed

#### Wallet Connection Issues
- [ ] Debug Coinbase wallet not prompting
- [ ] Debug Phantom wallet not prompting
- [ ] Test WalletConnect flow across all supported wallets
- [ ] Add better error messaging for connection failures
- [ ] Document wallet connection troubleshooting

---

### 4. Code Quality & Minor Fixes (Priority: LOW)

#### Copilot Feedback Items
- [ ] **src/app/labs/register/page.tsx** - Improve catch block comment:
  ```typescript
  // Current: } catch { // ignore }
  // Better: } catch {
  //   // It is safe to ignore errors here because URLSearchParams or window.location
  //   // may not be available in some environments (e.g., during SSR or non-browser contexts).
  //   // In such cases, test helpers are not shown.
  // }
  ```

- [ ] **src/wagmi.ts** - Consider extracting type casting helper:
  ```typescript
  // Current: Direct type casting with inline comment
  // Improvement: Create reusable helper if pattern repeats elsewhere
  ```

### Typography Hierarchy
- **H1 (Hero):** Large, bold, immediate impact
- **Subheading:** Clear value proposition
- **Body:** Concise, scannable content
- **CTAs:** High contrast, unmissable

### Interaction Design
- Scroll reveals should feel natural, not gimmicky
- Animations should be subtle and purposeful (60fps minimum)
- Hover states should provide clear feedback
- Mobile touch targets: minimum 44px √ó 44px
