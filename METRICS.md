## Notes

- **Code Coverage**: 98% measured via Jest coverage report (statement coverage). Comprehensive component and utility test coverage across 16 test suites with 213 tests.
- **Build Performance**: 35.13s for production build using Next.js Turbopack (local PowerShell measurement).
- **Test Status**: 274 total tests passing (100%). Unit tests: 213 passing. Playwright E2E: 61 passing. All accessibility tests pass WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
- **Lines of Code**: 21,791 LOC (excluding tests, generated files, config, node_modules, build artifacts).
- **Test Infrastructure**: Production build strategy resolved all test issues. Playwright uses `npm run start` instead of dev server to ensure proper React hydration and DOM rendering.
- **Docker Strategy**: Built Docker image for CI-consistent testing. Successfully generates visual regression baselines matching CI exactly.
- **Visual Tests**: All 9 Playwright visual regression tests passing with Docker-generated baselines. Projects page uses maxDiffPixels: 100000 (~2% tolerance) for dynamic animations and Spline 3D content.
- **Security**: Zero npm audit vulnerabilities. All dependencies current with no high/critical security alerts.
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance validated with axe-core. All 13 pages (4 main + 9 Labs) have proper landmarks, skip-link targets, and semantic HTML.
